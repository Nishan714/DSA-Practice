# DSA-Practice

Welcome to my repository for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is a collection of my solutions to various problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and others. The goal is to systematically improve my problem-solving skills and maintain a structured record of my progress.

Solutions are provided in three languages: C, Java, and Python.

## Introduction

This repository is a reflection of my learning journey in data structures and algorithms. Each solution is implemented with clarity and efficiency in mind, and includes comments where necessary to explain the logic and approach.

The problems are organized by the core data structure or algorithm they represent, making it easy to find solutions for specific topics.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into folders based on the primary data structure or algorithm category. Within each of these folders, you'll find subfolders for each programming language used.

Here is a sample of the directory structure:

├── Arrays/

│   ├── C/
│   │   └── problem_name.c
│   ├── Java/
│   │   └── ProblemName.java
│   └── Python/
│       └── problem_name.py

├── Linked_Lists/

│   ├── C/
│   ├── Java/
│   └── Python/

├── Stacks_and_Queues/
│   ├── C/
│   ├── Java/
│   └── Python/

├── Trees/

│   ├── C/
│   ├── Java/
│   └── Python/

├── Graphs/

│   ├── C/
│   ├── Java/
│   └── Python/

└── README.md

Each solution file includes:
- A brief description of the problem.
- The algorithm or approach used to solve it.
- The code itself, well-commented for clarity.

## Languages Used

This repository currently contains solutions implemented in the following programming languages:

- **C:** For a foundational understanding of memory management and low-level data structures.
- **Java:** For practice with object-oriented programming concepts and the robust standard library.
- **Python:** For quick prototyping and leveraging its high-level abstractions.

## How to Navigate

To explore the solutions, simply browse the folders. For example, to find a solution for a linked list problem in Java, you would go to `Linked_Lists/Java/`.

## Progress & Statistics

This section will be updated as I add more solutions to the repository. I'll use this space to track my progress, document the platforms I've used, and highlight some of the key problems I've solved.
